# qq
Multidistributions package simply manager

I created it because I often don't realize which distribution I'm currently in. So I simplified and unified the package managers.

Use:
* qq i -> update and instalation package
* qq r -> remove package
* qq q -> search in DB
* qq s -> show about package
* qq u -> upgrade
* qq cc -> cache cleaning
